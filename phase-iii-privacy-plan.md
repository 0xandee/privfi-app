# Phase III Privacy Implementation Plan

## Current Architecture Analysis

Your app currently implements:
- **Direct flow**: User → AVNU Swap → Typhoon Deposit → Withdraw
- **Typhoon integration**: Deposit/withdraw with SDK data persistence
- **Privacy limitation**: User wallet directly interacts with AVNU, creating on-chain linkage

## Enhanced Phase III Privacy System

### 1. **Advanced Privacy Architecture** (`features/privacy/`)

- **PrivacyDepositManager**: Manages multiple simultaneous shielded deposits
  - Track multiple Typhoon deposits per user
  - Support optional extra deposit amounts for enhanced privacy
  - Balance tracking and deposit history management

- **ClientSideEncryption**: Encrypt swap parameters before proxy communication
  - Encrypt order details (amount, tokens, slippage) client-side
  - Secure key exchange with proxy wallet
  - Prevent parameter exposure during transmission

- **ProxyWalletService**: Single proxy wallet with advanced capabilities
  - Hot wallet with secure private key storage
  - Sequential transaction processing to avoid nonce conflicts
  - ETH pre-funding for gas fees

- **Phase 3**: Proxy wallet receives encrypted order and withdraws needed amount from Typhoon
- **Phase 4**: Proxy executes swap via AVNU API with decrypted parameters
- **Phase 5**: Proxy re-deposits swapped tokens to Typhoon
- **Phase 6**: User withdraws to chosen recipient(s) - single or multiple addresses

### 3. **Backend Service Layer** (`src/services/proxyService/`)

- **ProxyExecutor**: Handles proxy wallet operations
  - Manages Typhoon withdrawal with proxy as recipient
  - Executes AVNU swaps from proxy wallet (including multi-route/partial fills)
  - Re-deposits to Typhoon after swap
  - Implements automatic fund recovery on failure

- **ProxyWalletService**: Direct wallet management
  - Hot wallet approach with private key storage

## How Phase III Privacy Works - The Complete Flow

### The Big Picture: Maximum Privacy Trading

Here's what happens when you trade on PrivFi with Phase III enhanced privacy:

#### **Step 1: Privacy Shield Deposit**
- You deposit regular tokens into Typhoon (shield operation)
- **Optional Privacy Buffer**: Deposit extra amount for enhanced privacy mixing
  - Example: Deposit 100 USDC to swap 50 USDC (the extra 50 USDC stays shielded for future use or additional privacy)
  - No limits on extra amounts - you choose freely
- **Multiple Deposits Supported**: You can have several active shielded deposits simultaneously
- **Balance Visibility**: Your total shielded balance in Typhoon is displayed in the UI

#### **Step 2: Encrypted Order Creation**
- When you want to trade, your swap order details get **encrypted client-side** before transmission
- Encrypted parameters include: token pair, amounts, slippage tolerance, recipient preferences
- **Zero exposure**: Even if network traffic is intercepted, swap details remain private
- Order encryption happens entirely in your browser - never stored on servers

#### **Step 3: Anonymous Proxy Execution**
- The proxy wallet receives your encrypted order and decrypts it securely
- Proxy withdraws only the needed amount from Typhoon (not your entire balance)
- **Complete Unlinkability**: The proxy wallet has no connection to your identity
- Proxy executes the swap via AVNU using optimal routing and handling partial fills

#### **Step 4: Re-Shielding**
- Proxy immediately re-deposits the swapped tokens back to Typhoon
- Your swapped tokens are now shielded and ready for withdrawal
- **No waiting period**: You can withdraw immediately after proxy completes re-deposit

#### **Step 5: Flexible Private Withdrawal**
- **Single or Multiple Recipients**: Withdraw to one address or split across multiple addresses
- **Custom Splits**: Configure withdrawals as percentages or fixed amounts
  - Example: Send 60% to Address A, 40% to Address B
  - Or: Send exactly 25 USDC to Address A, rest to Address B
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Multiple recipients further obscure fund destinations

### Privacy Guarantees

✅ **Transaction Unlinkability**: No on-chain connection between your deposit and DEX interaction
✅ **Parameter Privacy**: Swap details encrypted client-side, never exposed in transit
✅ **Recipient Privacy**: Withdraw to any address(es), not just your original wallet
✅ **Amount Privacy**: Optional extra deposits obscure your actual trading amounts
✅ **Timing Privacy**: Multiple users mixing in the same proxy creates shared anonymity sets

- **Transparent UX** with clear progress tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Current Flow Analysis
Based on codebase analysis:

1. **Current Privacy Flow** (`TyphoonService.ts`):
   ```
   User Wallet → AVNU Swap → Typhoon Deposit → User Withdrawal
   ```
   - User directly interacts with AVNU (privacy leak)
   - Single-phase Typhoon deposit after swap
   - Manual withdrawal by user

2. **Enhanced Privacy Flow** (Proposed):
   ```
   User → Typhoon Deposit → Proxy Withdrawal → AVNU Swap → Typhoon Re-deposit → User Withdrawal
   ```
   - Complete separation between user and DEX interaction
   - Proxy wallet as intermediary
   - Multi-phase orchestration

### Component Integration Points

1. **SwapInterface.tsx**: Add privacy mode selector
2. **useSwapExecution.ts**: Extend for proxy flow orchestration
3. **TyphoonService.ts**: Add proxy wallet withdrawal methods
4. **DEXFactory.ts**: Route through proxy for enhanced privacy mode

### Proxy Wallet Architecture Options

Based on your feedback about undecided proxy wallet approach, here are the options:

1. **Single Shared Wallet** (Recommended for MVP):
   - One proxy wallet serves all users
   - Simplest to implement and manage
   - Uses transaction queuing to prevent conflicts
   - Good privacy for most use cases

2. **Rotating Wallet Pool**:
   - Multiple proxy wallets rotate randomly
   - Better privacy distribution
   - More complex state management
   - Higher operational overhead

3. **User-Specific Proxy Wallets**:
   - Each user gets a dedicated proxy
   - Maximum isolation but defeats privacy purpose
   - Highest operational complexity
   - Not recommended for privacy goals

### Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Proxy wallet private keys stored securely
2. **Paymaster Integration**: Sponsor gas fees without user token exposure
3. **Transaction Isolation**: Queue system prevents transaction conflicts
4. **Audit Trail**: Minimal logging to maintain privacy
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed proxy operations

### Next Steps

Start with **Step 1: Proxy Wallet Setup** to establish the foundation, then incrementally build the privacy flow orchestration.

## Enhanced Brainstorming & Implementation Considerations

### Refined Architecture Based on Requirements

#### Single Proxy Wallet Design
- **Wallet Management**: Hot wallet with private key in secure environment variables
- **Gas Strategy**: Pre-fund proxy wallet with ETH, monitor balance, auto-refill threshold
- **Transaction Ordering**: Simple queue system, process one swap at a time to avoid nonce conflicts
- **No Paymaster**: Direct ETH payment simplifies implementation and reduces dependencies

#### Committed Transaction Flow
- **No Cancellation**: Once user initiates enhanced privacy swap, it must complete all 5 phases
- **Progress Transparency**: Clear UI showing current phase and estimated completion time
- **Error Handling**: Automatic fund recovery to user's Typhoon deposit on any failure
- **User Experience**: Show clear warning about non-cancellable nature before starting

#### Minimal Logging Philosophy
- **Privacy-First**: No transaction amounts, user addresses, or swap details logged
- **Essential Only**: Log phases, timestamps, and error codes only
- **Ephemeral Data**: Clear temporary data after successful completion
- **No Analytics**: Zero metrics collection to maintain privacy focus

### Advanced Implementation Details

#### Enhanced Phase Transition Logic
```
Phase 1 (Privacy Shield): User → Typhoon Deposit (optional extra amount)
  ↓ (Support multiple simultaneous deposits, track balances)
Phase 2 (Order Encryption): Client-side swap parameter encryption
  ↓ (Encrypt token pair, amounts, slippage, recipients)
Phase 3 (Proxy Unshield): Proxy decrypts order → Typhoon withdrawal (exact needed amount)
  ↓ (Queue proxy withdrawal with decrypted parameters)
Phase 4 (Anonymous Swap): Proxy → AVNU → Proxy (different token)
  ↓ (Use AVNU's best route, handle partial fills, complete unlinkability)
Phase 5 (Proxy Re-shield): Proxy → Typhoon Deposit (swapped tokens)
  ↓ (Re-deposit output tokens to Typhoon, immediate availability)
Phase 6 (Flexible Unshield): User → Multiple Recipients (custom splits)
  ↓ (Single or multi-recipient withdrawal with amount configuration)
```

#### Error Recovery Scenarios
1. **Phase 2 Failure**: Return original deposit to user's Typhoon balance
2. **Phase 3 Failure**: Deposit withdrawn tokens back to Typhoon for user
3. **Phase 4 Failure**: Manual intervention to return swapped tokens to user
4. **Phase 5**: User controls final withdrawal (standard Typhoon process)

#### AVNU Integration Enhancement
- **Multi-Route Support**: Leverage AVNU's routing for best price execution
- **Partial Fill Handling**: Complete swaps even with partial fills
- **Slippage Protection**: Use user's slippage settings in proxy execution
- **Route Optimization**: Let AVNU handle complex routing (10KSwap, MySwap, etc.)

### Technical Architecture Decisions

#### Client-Side Encryption Architecture
```typescript
// Client-side encryption for swap parameters
interface EncryptedSwapOrder {
  orderId: string;
  encryptedParams: string; // AES-256 encrypted swap details
  publicKey: string; // For proxy wallet decryption
  timestamp: number;
  userAddress: string;
}

interface SwapParameters {
  fromToken: string;
  toToken: string;
  amount: string;
  slippage: number;
  recipients: RecipientSplit[];
  depositTxHash: string; // Which Typhoon deposit to use
}

class ClientSideEncryption {
  async encryptSwapOrder(params: SwapParameters): Promise<EncryptedSwapOrder> {
    const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
      { name: "RSA-OAEP", modulusLength: 2048, publicExponent: new Uint8Array([1, 0, 1]), hash: "SHA-256" },
      true, ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
    );

    const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
      { name: "RSA-OAEP" },
      keyPair.publicKey,
      new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(params))
    );

    return {
      orderId: crypto.randomUUID(),
      encryptedParams: arrayBufferToBase64(encrypted),
      publicKey: await exportKey(keyPair.publicKey),
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      userAddress: params.userAddress
    };
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Deposits Tracking System
```typescript
interface TyphoonDeposit {
  depositId: string;
  txHash: string;
  tokenAddress: string;
  amount: string;
  timestamp: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'available' | 'partially_used' | 'exhausted';
  remainingBalance?: string;
  userAddress: string;
}

class PrivacyDepositManager {
  private deposits: Map<string, TyphoonDeposit[]> = new Map();

  async trackDeposit(userAddress: string, deposit: TyphoonDeposit): Promise<void> {
    const userDeposits = this.deposits.get(userAddress) || [];
    userDeposits.push(deposit);
    this.deposits.set(userAddress, userDeposits);
  }

  getTotalBalance(userAddress: string, tokenAddress: string): string {
    const userDeposits = this.deposits.get(userAddress) || [];
    return userDeposits
      .filter(d => d.tokenAddress === tokenAddress && d.status === 'available')
      .reduce((total, d) => total + BigInt(d.remainingBalance || d.amount), 0n)
      .toString();
  }

  selectDepositForSwap(userAddress: string, tokenAddress: string, requiredAmount: string): TyphoonDeposit | null {
    const userDeposits = this.deposits.get(userAddress) || [];
    return userDeposits
      .filter(d => d.tokenAddress === tokenAddress && BigInt(d.remainingBalance || d.amount) >= BigInt(requiredAmount))
      .sort((a, b) => Number(BigInt(a.remainingBalance || a.amount) - BigInt(b.remainingBalance || b.amount)))[0] || null;
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Recipient Withdrawal System
```typescript
interface RecipientSplit {
  address: string;
  amount?: string; // Fixed amount
  percentage?: number; // Percentage of total
  label?: string; // User-friendly label
}

interface WithdrawalRequest {
  tokenAddress: string;
  totalAmount: string;
  recipients: RecipientSplit[];
  userAddress: string;
}

class MultiRecipientWithdrawal {
  validateRecipients(recipients: RecipientSplit[]): boolean {
    const totalPercentage = recipients
      .filter(r => r.percentage)
      .reduce((sum, r) => sum + (r.percentage || 0), 0);

    const hasFixedAmounts = recipients.some(r => r.amount);
    const hasPercentages = recipients.some(r => r.percentage);

    // Must be all percentages (totaling 100%) or all fixed amounts
    if (hasPercentages && hasFixedAmounts) return false;
    if (hasPercentages && Math.abs(totalPercentage - 100) > 0.01) return false;

    return true;
  }

  calculateSplits(totalAmount: string, recipients: RecipientSplit[]): Map<string, string> {
    const splits = new Map<string, string>();
    const total = BigInt(totalAmount);

    if (recipients[0].percentage) {
      // Percentage-based splits
      let remaining = total;
      recipients.forEach((recipient, index) => {
        if (index === recipients.length - 1) {
          splits.set(recipient.address, remaining.toString());
        } else {
          const amount = (total * BigInt(Math.floor((recipient.percentage || 0) * 100))) / 10000n;
          splits.set(recipient.address, amount.toString());
          remaining -= amount;
        }
      });
    } else {
      // Fixed amount splits
      recipients.forEach(recipient => {
        splits.set(recipient.address, recipient.amount || "0");
      });
    }

    return splits;
  }

  async executeMultiRecipientWithdrawal(request: WithdrawalRequest): Promise<string[]> {
    const splits = this.calculateSplits(request.totalAmount, request.recipients);
    const txHashes: string[] = [];

    for (const [address, amount] of splits) {
      const txHash = await this.typhoonService.withdraw({
        transactionHash: request.depositTxHash,
        recipientAddresses: [address],
        amount
      });
      txHashes.push(txHash);
    }

    return txHashes;
  }
}
```

#### Hot Wallet Security Model (Updated)
```typescript
// Environment-based key management with enhanced security
const PROXY_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PROXY_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY;
const MIN_ETH_BALANCE = process.env.MIN_PROXY_ETH_BALANCE || "0.1";
const ENCRYPTION_KEY = process.env.PROXY_ENCRYPTION_KEY; // For decrypting user orders

class ProxyWallet {
  private account: Account;
  private minBalance: bigint;
  private decryptionKey: CryptoKey;

  constructor() {
    this.account = new Account(provider, address, PROXY_PRIVATE_KEY);
    this.minBalance = parseEther(MIN_ETH_BALANCE);
    this.setupDecryption();
  }

  async decryptSwapOrder(encryptedOrder: EncryptedSwapOrder): Promise<SwapParameters> {
    const decrypted = await crypto.subtle.decrypt(
      { name: "RSA-OAEP" },
      this.decryptionKey,
      base64ToArrayBuffer(encryptedOrder.encryptedParams)
    );

    return JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted));
  }
}
```

#### Transaction Queue Implementation
```typescript
interface ProxySwapRequest {
  id: string;
  userDepositTxHash: string;
  fromToken: string;
  toToken: string;
  amount: string;
  userAddress: string;
  slippage: number;
  phase: 'pending' | 'withdrawing' | 'swapping' | 'depositing' | 'completed';
}

class ProxyTransactionQueue {
  private queue: ProxySwapRequest[] = [];
  private processing: boolean = false;

  // Simple FIFO processing
  async processNext() { /* ... */ }
}
```

#### State Persistence Strategy
- **User State**: Store user's swap progress in Zustand with persistence
- **Proxy State**: Minimal server-side queue state (cleared after completion)
- **Recovery Data**: Store essential recovery information temporarily
- **No Long-term Storage**: Clear all data after successful completion

### UI/UX Considerations

#### Privacy Mode Selection
- **Clear Explanation**: Explain enhanced privacy benefits vs. standard mode
- **Performance Trade-off**: Show estimated time difference (standard: ~30s, enhanced: ~5min)
- **Commitment Warning**: Clear warning about non-cancellable nature
- **Visual Distinction**: Different UI styling for enhanced privacy mode

#### Progress Visualization
```
Enhanced Privacy Swap Progress:
[■■■■■] Phase 1: Shielding tokens... (30s)
[□□□□□] Phase 2: Proxy withdrawal (60s)
[□□□□□] Phase 3: Anonymous swap (90s)
[□□□□□] Phase 4: Re-shielding tokens (60s)
[□□□□□] Phase 5: Ready to withdraw (user action)
```

#### Error Communication
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Avoid technical details, focus on next steps
- **Recovery Guidance**: Clear instructions for fund recovery
- **Support Contact**: Provide help channel for edge cases

### Operational Considerations

#### Proxy Wallet Maintenance
- **Balance Monitoring**: Alert when ETH balance drops below threshold
- **Health Checks**: Regular proxy wallet connectivity tests
- **Backup Strategy**: Multiple key storage locations for redundancy

#### Scaling Preparation
- **Single Wallet Limits**: Monitor transaction throughput
- **Future Multi-Wallet**: Design allows easy expansion to wallet pool
- **Load Balancing**: Plan for wallet rotation if needed

#### Privacy Validation
- **Transaction Analysis**: Verify no linkability between user and DEX
- **Timing Analysis**: Ensure no timing correlation attacks possible
- **Anonymity Set**: Single proxy creates shared anonymity set
